      limits are applied on aggregate across the Primary Account Card and all
      Sub-Card(s).`,

      '<b>Using Your Card, Card Number and Account Number</b>',

      `Subject to terms and limitations set forth in this Agreement, once you have
      activated your Card and we have verified your identity, you may use your Card, Card
      Number or Account Number, as applicable, to:

      <li>add funds to your Card Account (see section below labeled “Adding Funds to Your
      Card Account”),</li>
      <li>purchase goods or services wherever your Card is honored as long as you do not
      exceed the value available in your Card Account (see section below labeled “Using
      Your Card for Purchases”), as long as you do not exceed the available balance in
      your Card Account.</li>
      </ul>`,

      `There may be fees associated with some of these transactions; see the Fee
      Schedule above for more details.   Some of these services may not be available at
      all terminals. Each time you use your Card, Card Number or Account Number purchase
      goods or services, or initiate another type of funds transfer authorized by this
      Agreement, you authorize us to reduce the available balance in your Card Account
      by the amount of the transaction plus applicable fees, if any.`,

      `You agree that you will: 
      <ul>
      <li>not use your Card at gambling websites or to purchase illegal goods or

      The Card may not be accepted by certain merchants whose goods or services are not
      legal for minors.  We may refuse to process any transaction that we believe
      violates the terms of this Agreement.`,

      `(DO WE NEED THIS?) We will provide you our bank routing number and assign you a
      16-digit Account Number. Our bank routing number and your 16-digit Account Number
      is available online at  www.creditacademy.io  by logging in to your Card Account,
      and will be provided to you with your Card. The bank routing number and your
      assigned Account Number are for the purpose of initiating direct deposits to your
      Card Account and authorized ACH debit transactions only. The 16-digit Card Number
      designated to your Card should not be used for these types of transactions or they
      will be rejected. You are not authorized to use the bank routing number and Account
      Number to make a debit transaction with a paper check, check-by-phone or other item
      processed as a check, or if you do not have sufficient funds in your Card Account.
      These debits will be declined and your payment will not be processed and fees may
      apply.`,

      '<b>Personal Identification Number “PIN”</b>',

      `A PIN is a four-digit code that may be used to make purchase transactions instead
      of signing for your transaction.  A PIN was provided to you at the time you
      activated the Card. Only one (1) PIN will be issued for the Card.  To prevent
      unauthorized access to the Card balance, you agree to keep your PIN confidential.
      We recommend that you memorize your PIN and do not write it down. You may change or
      reset your PIN by calling1-855-449-2273. Some merchants may require you to make
      purchases using a PIN rather than your signature.`,

      '<b>Limitations on Card Usage</b>',

      `Use of your Card is subject to the limitations set forth below, and no transaction
      may exceed the value available in your Card Account.  Limits are applied on
      aggregate across the Primary Account Card and all Sub-Cards. For security reasons,
      we may further limit the amount or number of transactions you can make with your
      Card on a daily or monthly basis, or in the aggregate, and we may limit the dollar
      amount of transactions to or from your Card Account. We may increase or decrease
      these limits or add additional limits from time to time in our sole discretion
      without prior notice to you except as required by law.`,

      '<b>Adding Funds to Your Card Account.</b>',

      `You may add funds to your Card Account, called “loading,” at any time, subject to
      the limitations in the Section above entitled “Limitations on Card Usage”.
      Merchants and banks may have additional limitations.  We reserve the right to
      accept or reject any request to load value to your Card Account.  The Card Account
      may only be loaded by the Card Owner or on your behalf.  There may be a fee imposed
      by the originating bank or retailer for a load transaction.  Loads are subject to
      appropriate anti-fraud verification. Certain delays may be required to assure funds
      are available for loads prior to crediting to your Card Account and making funds
      available to you. All loads must be made in U.S. dollars.  you cannot load your
      Card Account by check or money order.`,

      `Funds may be loaded by the Card Owner through one or more of the following means:
      <ul>
      <li><b>Direct Deposit</b></li>
      <li><b>ACH Transfer:</b></li>
      </ul>
      You may transfer funds to your Card Account from an eligible checking or savings
      account held by you at a U.S. financial institution by means of an Automated
      Clearing House ("<b>ACH</b>”) transaction. By requesting such a transfer, you
      represent that you are the owner of such bank account and, if there are
      additional owners, you are authorized by them to withdraw or add funds and take all
      other actions required or permitted by this Agreement.  When you provide us with
      your bank account information, we may verify your authority and/or access to the
      bank account you identify. There is a fee for loading funds to your Card Account
      via ACH transfer (see our Fee Schedule for fee information).`,

      '<b>Using Your Card for Purchases</b>',

      `You can use your Card to purchase goods and services everywhere Mastercard prepaid
      cards are accepted, subject to the limitations in the Section above entitled
      “Limitations on Card Usage”.  If you do not have enough funds available in your
      Card Account for the entire purchase, you can instruct the merchant to charge part
      of the purchase to your Card Account and pay the remaining amount with other funds.
      These are called split transactions and some merchants do not permit them. If a
      merchant attempts to process a transaction for more than the value available in
      your Card Account, or if the transaction will cause the purchase limit we have
      established to be exceeded, then the transaction will be declined.  Unusual or
      multiple purchases may prompt a merchant inquiry or card suspension to allow us to
      investigate such unusual activity.`,

      `If you use your Card Number or Account Number without presenting your Card (such
      as for mail order, telephone or Internet purchases), the legal effect will be the
      same as if you used the Card itself.  For mail order, telephone, Internet or
      other card-not-present purchases, merchants may choose to route a transaction
      through as a PIN or signature purchase.  In these circumstances, we recommend
      that you ask the merchant whether your transaction will be routed as a PIN or
      signature transaction, to the extent we assess different fees for PIN and
      signature purchase transactions (see our Fee Schedule above).`,

      `When you use your Card Account to pay for goods or services, certain merchants may
      ask us to authorize the transaction in advance and may estimate its final value.
      When we authorize the transaction, we commit to make the requested funds available
      when the transaction finally settles and may place a temporary hold on your Card’s
      funds for the amount indicated by the merchant (which may be more than the final
      settled transaction amount).  If you use your Card at a restaurant, a hotel, for
      a car rental purchase, or for similar purchases, the merchant may preauthorize
      the transaction amount for the purchase amount plus up to 20% more to ensure
      there are sufficient funds available to cover tips or incidental expenses
      incurred.  Transactions at certain merchants that authorize high dollar amounts,
      especially rental car companies and hotels, may cause an “authorization” or
      “hold” on your available balance for up to thirty (30) days.  Until the
      transaction finally settles or we determine that it is unlikely to be processed,
      the funds subject to the hold will not be available to you for other purposes.
      We will only charge your Card Account for the correct amount of the final
      transaction, however, and will release the hold on any excess amount when the
      transaction finally settles.`,

      '<b>Negative Balance</b>',

      `You acknowledge and agree that the value available in your Card Account is limited
      to the funds that have been loaded to your Card Account by you or on your behalf.
      Each time you use your Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available in your
      Card Account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. You may not
      initiate transactions exceeding the available balance in your Card Account.
      Nevertheless, if any fees, transaction fees from merchants or other activity cause
      your Card Account to have a negative balance, you agree to pay us immediately for
      the full amount of the negative balance without further demand.  We do not offer an
      overdraft or other credit feature with this Card.  We may deduct the negative
      balance owing from any current or future funds loaded to your Card Account or any
      other account you activate or maintain with us.  If your Card Account has a zero or
      negative balance, we may, at our option, cancel your Card Account without notice.`,

      '<b>Refunds for Purchases Made with the Card</b>',

      `Any refund for goods or services purchased with the Card Account will be made in
      the form of a credit to the Card.  You are not entitled to receive a cash refund.`,

      '<b>Disputes with Merchants</b>',

      `We are not responsible for the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other
      aspect of goods and services that you purchase from others with a Card.  All such
      disputes should be addressed to the merchants from whom the goods and services
      were purchased.`,

      '<b>Reversal</b>',

      `Point of sale transactions cannot be reversed. If you authorize a transaction and
      then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a
      hold of funds equal to the estimated purchase amount, for up to seven (7) days.`,

      '<b>Fee Schedule</b>',

      `We will charge you, and you agree to pay, the fees and charges set forth in the
      Fee Schedule above. You may also login at www.creditacademy.io to view a complete
      list of fees.  We generally deduct fees and charges from the Card Account at the
      time a fee or charge is incurred. If you request a service that is not included in
      the Fee Schedule, if there is a fee for such service it will be disclosed at that
      time, and you agree that any such fee may be deducted from your Card Account.`,

      '<b>Receipts and Transaction History</b>',

      `<b>Receipts.</b>  You should get a receipt from the merchant at the time you make
      a transaction using your Card.  Please note there are some merchants that choose
      not to provide a receipt if the amount of the transaction is $15 or less.`,

      `<b>Card Account Balance and Transaction History.</b>  You can obtain information
      about the amount of money you have remaining in your Card Account by calling
      1-855-449-2273l.You will not be assessed a fee to check your balance using our
      automated telephone system, although you may be assessed a fee if you wish to speak

      charge by logging in to your Card Account at www.creditacademy.io.  You also have

      history unless you request it more than once per month.  See our Fee Schedule for
      fee information.`,

      '<b>Foreign Transactions</b>',

      `If you obtain your funds (or make a purchase) in a currency other than U.S.
      dollars, the amount deducted from your funds will be converted by the Mastercard
      Card Association into U.S. dollars.  The Mastercard Card Association will establish
      a currency conversion rate for this convenience using a rate selected by the
      Mastercard Card Association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency
      markets for the applicable central processing date which may vary from the rate the
      Mastercard Card Association itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in
      effect for the applicable central processing date, in each instance.  Fees may
      apply for foreign transactions (see our Fee Schedule above).`,

      '<b>Change in Terms</b>',

      `Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we may at any time
      add to, delete or change the terms of this Agreement without advance notice to you
      except as required by law. Advance notice may not be given if we need to make the
      change immediately in order to maintain or restore the security of your Card or
      Card Account or any related payment system.`,

      '<b>Cancellation and Suspension</b>',

      `We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit your use of the Card.  We
      may refuse to issue a Card Account or may revoke or suspect your Card Account
      privileges with or without cause or notice, other than as required by applicable
      law.  If you would like to cancel the use of your Card, contact us at

      provided. You agree not to use or allow others to use an expired, revoked,

      privileges will not otherwise affect your rights and obligations under this
      Agreement.  Unless you have engaged in fraud or other illegal activities using your
      Card, if your Card Account privileges are cancelled or suspended, you may request
      the unused balance to be returned to you via a check to the mailing address we have
      in our records. There may be a fee for this service.  See our Fee Schedule above
      for fee information.`,

      '<b>Card Expiration/Settlement</b>',

      `Subject to applicable law, you may use the Card only through its expiration date,
      which is stated on the front of the Card.  If you attempt to use the Card or add
      funds to your Card Account after the expiration date, the transactions may not be
      processed.  If there is a balance remaining in your Card Account upon expiration, a
      new Card may be issued to you. You must activate any newly issued Card in order to
      access the funds in your Card Account.  If we do not choose to issue a new Card to

      '<b>Agreement to Arbitrate</b>',

      `You and we (defined below) agree that any Dispute (defined below) will be resolved
      by Arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is governed by the Federal Arbitration
      Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the substantive law of the State of Minnesota
      (without applying its choice-of-law rules).`,

      '<b>What Arbitration Is</b>',

      `"Arbitration" is a means of having an independent third party resolve a Dispute. A
      "Dispute" is any claim or controversy of any kind between you and us. The term
      Dispute is to be given its broadest possible meaning and includes, without
      limitation, all claims or demands (whether past, present, or future, including
      events that occurred prior to your application for a Sunrise Banks account or
      Card and whether or not a Sunrise Banks Mastercard prepaid card is provided to
      you, based on any legal or equitable theory (contract, tort, or otherwise) and
      regardless of the type of relief sought (i.e., money, injunctive relief, or
      declaratory relief). A Dispute includes, by way of example and without
      limitation, any claim based upon a federal or state constitution, statute,
      ordinance, regulation, or common law, and any issue concerning the validity,
      enforceability, or scope of this arbitration agreement.`,

      `For purposes of this arbitration agreement, the terms "you" and "your" include any
      Authorized User, co-signer, co-obligor, or guarantor and also your heirs, guardian,
      personal representative, or trustee in bankruptcy. The terms "we," "our," and "us"
      mean either the Bank and include employees, officers, directors, members, managers,
      attorneys, affiliated companies, predecessors, and assigns the Bank as well as the
      marketing, servicing, and collection representatives and agents of either or
      both.`,

      '<b>How Arbitration Works</b>',

      `If a Dispute arises, the party asserting the claim or demand must initiate
      arbitration, provided you or we may first try to resolve the matter informally or
      through customary business methods, including collection activity. The party filing
      an arbitration complaint must choose either of the following arbitration firms for
      initiating and pursuing arbitration: the American Arbitration Association ("AAA")
      or JAMS, The Resolution Experts. If the parties mutually agree, a private party,
      such as a retired judge, may serve as the arbitrator. If you claim you have a
      Dispute with us, but do not initiate arbitration or select an arbitrator, we may do
      so. You may obtain copies of the current rules of each of the arbitration firms and
      forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by contacting them as
      follows:<br />
      American Arbitration Association<br />
      1633 Broadway, 10th Floor<br />
      New York, NY 10019<br />
      Web site: www.adr.org<br />
      Telephone (800) 778-7879`,

      `JAMS, The Resolution Experts<br />
      1920 Main Street, Suite 300<br />
      Irvine, CA 92614<br />
      Web site: www.jamsadr.com<br />
      Telephone (949) 224-1810 or (800) 352-5267`,

      `In the event both AAA and JAMS are unavailable to decide a Dispute, the parties
      agree to select another neutral party experienced in financial matters to decide
      the Dispute.  If such an independent arbitrator cannot be found, the parties agree
      to submit any Dispute to a state or federal judge, sitting without a jury, for
      resolution on an individual and not a class-wide basis.`,

      `The policies and procedures of the selected arbitration firm will apply provided
      such policies and procedures are consistent with this arbitration agreement. To the
      extent the arbitration firm's rules or procedures are different than the terms of
      this arbitration agreement, the terms of this arbitration agreement will apply.`,

      '<b>What Arbitration Costs</b>',

      `No matter which party initiates the arbitration, we will advance or reimburse
      filing fees and other costs or fees of arbitration, provided each party will be
      initially responsible for its own attorneys' fees and related costs. Unless
      prohibited by law, the arbitrator may award fees, costs, and reasonable attorneys'
      fees to the party who substantially prevails in the arbitration.`,

      '<b>Location of Arbitration</b>',

      `Unless you and we agree to a different location, the arbitration will be conducted
      in the county where you reside.`,

      '<b>Waiver of Rights</b>',

      `You are waiving your right to a jury trial, to have a court decide your Dispute,
      to participate in a class action lawsuit, and to certain discovery and other
      procedures that are available in a lawsuit. You and we agree that the arbitrator
      has no authority to conduct class-wide arbitration proceedings and is only
      authorized to resolve the individual Disputes between you and us. The validity,
      effect, and enforceability of this waiver of class action lawsuit and class-wide
      arbitration, if challenged, are to be determined solely by a court of competent
      jurisdiction and not by the AAA, JAMS, or an arbitrator. If such court refuses to
      enforce the waiver of class-wide arbitration, the Dispute will proceed in court and
      be decided by a judge, sitting without a jury, according to applicable court rules
      and procedures, and not as a class action lawsuit. The arbitrator has the ability
      to award all remedies available by statute, at law, or in equity to the prevailing
      party.`,

      '<b>Applicable Law and Review of Arbitrator\'s Award</b>',

      `The arbitrator shall apply applicable federal and Minnesota substantive law and
      the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator must apply the terms of this
      arbitration agreement, including without limitation the waiver of class-wide
      arbitration. The arbitrator shall make written findings and the arbitrator's award
      may be filed with any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration award shall be
      supported by substantial evidence and must be consistent with this Agreement and
      with applicable law, and if it is not, it may be set aside by a court. The parties
      shall have, in addition to the grounds referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act
      for vacating, modifying, or correcting an award, the right to judicial review of
      (a) whether the findings of fact rendered by the arbitrator are supported by
      substantial evidence and (b) whether the conclusions of law are erroneous under
      the substantive law of Minnesota and applicable federal law. Judgment confirming an
      award in such a proceeding may be entered only if a court determines that the award
      is supported by substantial evidence and is not based on legal error under the
      substantive law of Minnesota and applicable federal law.`,

      '<b>Surviva</b>',

      `This arbitration provision shall survive:
      <ul style='list-style-type: lower-roman'>
      <li>cancellation, payment, charge-off, or assignment of this Agreement;</li>
      <li>the bankruptcy of any party; and</li>
      <li>any transfer, sale, or assignment of this Agreement, or any amounts owed under
      this Agreement, to any other person or entity.</li>`,

      '<b>Right to Opt-Out</b>',

      `If you do not wish to agree to arbitrate all Disputes in accordance with the terms
      and conditions of this section, you must advise us in writing at the following
      address by either hand delivery or a letter postmarked within thirty (30) days

      '<b>Assignability</b>',

      `We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement at any
      time without prior notice to you.  The Card Account established under this
      Agreement is not assignable or transferable by you.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      this Agreement shall be binding on you, your Authorized Users, your heirs, your
      executors, administrators, guardians, personal representatives, or trustee in
      bankruptcy.`,

      '<b>Miscellaneous Provisions</b>',

      `We do not waive our rights by delaying or failing to execute them at any time.  To
      the extent permitted by law and as permitted by the Waiver of Jury Trial and
      Arbitration above, you agree to be liable to us for any loss, costs, or expenses
      that we may incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding involving your
      Account.  If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or
      unenforceable, such finding shall not make the rest of this Agreement invalid or
      unenforceable.  To the fullest extent possible, any such provision shall be deemed
      to be modified so as to be rendered enforceable or valid; however, if such
      provision cannot be so modified, it shall be stricken and all other provisions of
      this Agreement in all other respects shall remain valid and enforceable.`,
