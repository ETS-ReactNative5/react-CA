    question: 'How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?',
    answer: [
      `A significant benefit and innovation of Credit Academy’s Services is that you can
      connect your Account with a third- party account or platform. For the purposes of
      this Privacy Statement, an “account connection” with such a third-party is a
      connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a non-Credit Academy
      account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own. When you
      authorize such a connection, Credit Academy and the third-party will exchange your
      Personal Data and other information directly. Examples of account connections include:`,

      `<ul>
      <li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;</li>
      <li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company,
      if you provide such company with your Account log-in credentials; or</li>
      <li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.</li>
      </ul>`,

      `If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the
      third-party about you and your use of the third-party’s service. For example, if
      you connect your Account to a social media account, we will receive Personal Data
      from the social media provider via the account connection. If you connect your
      Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service
      provider, we may have access to your account balance and transactional information,
      such as purchases. We will use all such information that we receive from a
      third-party via an account connection in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement.`,

      `Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will
      be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.
      Before authorizing an account connection, you should review the privacy notice of
      any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the account
      connection. For example, Personal Data that Credit Academy shares with a
      third-party account or platform such as a social media account may in turn be
      shared with certain other parties, including the general public, depending on
      the account’s or platform’s privacy practices.`,
