      `<b>Virtual Card.</b> The Virtual Card is a prepaid virtual account. The Virtual Card allows
      you to access funds loaded or deposited to your Virtual Card Account by you or on your
      behalf. Your Virtual Card Account does not constitute a checking or savings account and is
      not connected in any way to any other account you may have. The Virtual Card is not a gift
      card, nor is it intended to be used for gifting purposes. The Virtual Card is not a credit
      card and may not provide the same rights to you as those available in credit card
      transactions. You will not receive any interest on the funds in your virtual Card Account.
      The funds in the Virtual Card Account will be insured for the benefit of the Virtual Card
      Owner to the maximum limit provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provided we
      have been able to verify your identity. Your funds will never expire, regardless of the
      expiration date associated with your Virtual Card. The Virtual Card will remain the property
      of the Bank and is nontransferable.`,

      `<b>Activating Your Virtual Card.</b> You cannot use the Virtual Card until it has been
      activated. Virtual Cards will be activated automatically before you are presented with the
      Virtual Card Number. To set up and activate a Virtual Card, login to www.creditacademy.io or
      call 1-855-449-2273 and follow the instructions provided. As part of the activation, you may
      be required to provide your Social Security Number and date of birth. Although no credit
      history is required to obtain a Virtual Card, you authorize us to obtain information about
      you from time to time from credit reporting agencies, your employers and other third parties
      for our internal processes.`,

      `<b>Virtual Sub-Card.</b> You may request additional Virtual Card(s), called Virtual
      Sub-Card(s), for your use or use by another person who is an Authorized User. The maximum
      number of Virtual Sub-Cards permitted is five (5). Authorized User(s) must be over the age
      of 13. You must notify us to revoke permission for any person you previously authorized to
      use the Virtual Card(s). You are liable for all transactions made with the Virtual Card(s)
      or Virtual Card Number(s) by your Authorized User(s). You are the Virtual Card Owner and are
      responsible for all transactions and fees incurred by you or any Authorized User(s). You are
      wholly responsible for the use of each Virtual Card according to the terms of this
      Agreement. Virtual Sub-Card(s) may only be loaded from the Virtual Primary Account by
      Virtual Card-to-Virtual Card transfer; funds cannot be loaded to the Virtual Sub-Card(s) by
      Direct Deposit or ACH Transfer.  Daily purchase limits are applied on aggregate across the
      Virtual Primary Account Card and all Virtual Sub-Card(s).`,

      `<b>Using Your Virtual Card, Virtual Card Number.</b> Subject to terms and limitations set
      forth in this Agreement, once you have activated your Virtual Card and we have verified your
      identity, you may use your Virtual Card or Virtual Card Number  as applicable, to: (1) add
      funds to your Virtual Card Account (see section below labeled “Adding Funds to Your Virtual
      Card Account”), (2) purchase goods or services (via Internet, Telephone, and Mail Orderonly)
      as long as you do not exceed the value available in your Virtual Card Account (see section
      below labeled “Using Your Virtual Card for Purchases”). There may be fees associated with
      some of these transactions; see the List of All Fees above for more details.`,

      `Each time you use your Virtual Card or Virtual Card Number to purchase goods or services,
      or initiate another type of funds transfer authorized by this Agreement, you authorize us to
      reduce the available balance in your Virtual Card Account by the amount of the transaction
      plus applicable fees, if any. You agree that you will: (i) not use your Virtual Card at
      gambling websites or to purchase illegal goods or services; (ii) promptly notify us of any

      (v) use the Virtual Card only as permitted by us. The Virtual Card may not be accepted by
      certain merchants whose goods or services are not legal for minors. We may refuse to process
      any transaction that we believe violates the terms of this Agreement.`,

      `<b>Personal Identification Number “PIN”:</b> A PIN is a four-digit code that may be used to
      make purchase transactions instead of signing for your transaction. A PIN was provided to
      you along with your Virtual Card Account. Only one (1) PIN will be issued for the Virtual
      Card. To prevent unauthorized access to the Virtual Card balance, you agree to keep your PIN
      confidential. We recommend that you memorize your PIN and do not write it down. You may
      change or reset your PIN by calling 1-855-449-2273 or logging into your account at
      www.creditacademy.io. Some merchants may require you to make purchases using a PIN rather
      than your signature.`,

      `<b>Limitations on Virtual Card Usage.</b> Use of your Virtual Card is subject to the
      limitations set forth below, and no transaction may exceed the value available in your
      Virtual Card Account. Limits are applied on aggregate across the Primary Virtual Account
      Card and all Virtual Sub-Cards. For security reasons, we may further limit the amount or
      number of transactions you can make with your Virtual Card on a daily or monthly basis, or
      in the aggregate, and we may limit the dollar amount of transactions to or from your Virtual
      Card Account. We may increase or decrease these limits or add additional limits from time to
      time in our sole discretion without prior notice to you except as required by law.`,

      `<b>Adding Funds to Your Virtual Card Account.</b> You may add funds to your Virtual Card
      Account, called “loading,” at any time, subject to the limitations in the Section above
      entitled “Limitations on Virtual Card Usage”. Merchants and banks may have additional
      limitations. We reserve the right to accept or reject any request to load value to your
      Virtual Card Account. The Virtual Card Account may only be loaded by the Virtual Card Owner.
      There may be a fee imposed by the originating bank for a load transaction. Loads are subject
      to appropriate anti-fraud verification. Certain delays may be required to assure funds are
      available for loads prior to crediting to your Virtual Card Account and making funds
      available to you. All loads must be made in U.S. dollars. you cannot load your Virtual Card
      Account by check or money order. Funds may be loaded by the Virtual Card Owner through the
      following means:`,

      `<b>1. ACH Transfer:</b>You may transfer funds to your Virtual Card Account from an
      eligible checking or savings account held by you at a U.S. financial institution by means of
      an Automated Clearing House ("<b>ACH</b>”) transaction. By requesting such a transfer, you
      represent that you are the owner of such bank account and, if there are additional owners,
      you are authorized by them to withdraw or add funds and take all other actions required or
      permitted by this Agreement. When you provide us with your bank account information, we may
      verify your authority and/or access to the bank account you identify.`,

      `<b>Using Your Virtual Card for Purchases:</b> You can use your Virtual Card to purchase
      goods and services (via Internet, Telephone, and Mail Order only) everywhere Debit
      Mastercard is accepted, subject to the limitations in the Section above entitled
      “Limitations on virtual Card Usage”. If you do not have enough funds available in your
      Virtual Card Account for the entire purchase, you can instruct the merchant to charge part
      of the purchase to your Virtual Card Account and pay the remaining amount with other
      funds.  These are called split transactions and some merchants do not permit them. If a
      merchant attempts to process a transaction for more than the value available in your Virtual
      Card Account, or if the transaction will cause the purchase limit we have established to be
      exceeded, then the transaction will be declined. Unusual or multiple purchases may prompt a
      merchant inquiry or Virtual Card suspension to allow us to investigate such unusual
      activity.`,

      `When you use your Virtual Card Number for purchases via mail order, telephone or Internet,
      the legal effect will be the same as if you used the Card itself. For mail order, telephone,
      Internet or other card-not-present purchases, merchants may choose to route a transaction
      through as a PIN or signature purchase. In these circumstances, we recommend that you ask
      the merchant whether your transaction will be routed as a PIN or signature transaction, to
      the extent we may access different fees for PIN or signature purchase transactions (see
      List of All Fees above).`,

      `<b>Negative Balance.</b> You acknowledge and agree that the value available in your Virtual
      Card Account is limited to the funds that have been loaded to your Virtual Card Account by
      you. Each time you use your Virtual Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available in
      your Virtual Card Account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. You may
      not initiate transactions exceeding the available balance in your Virtual Card Account.
      Nevertheless, if any fees, transaction fees from merchants or other activity cause your
      Virtual Card Account to have a negative balance, you agree to pay us immediately for the
      full amount of the negative balance without further demand. We do not offer an overdraft or
      other credit feature with this Virtual Card. We may deduct the negative balance owing from
      any current or future funds loaded to your Virtual Card Account or any other account you
      activate or maintain with us. If your Virtual Card Account has a zero or negative balance,
      we may, at our option, cancel your Virtual Card Account without notice.`,

      `<b>Preauthorized Payments from Your Virtual Card.</b> You may preauthorize a merchant to
      make recurring electronic funds transfers from your Virtual Card Account. If these regular
      payments may vary in amount, the person you are going to pay will tell you ten (10) days
      before the payment is due when it will be deducted from your Virtual Card Account value and
      how much it will be. If you have told us in advance to make regular, recurring payments
      from your Virtual Card Account, you can stop any of these payments by calling us at
      1-855-449-2273 or emailing us at
      <a href="mailto:customerservice@ficentive.com">customerservice@ficentive.com</a>, or writing

      receive your request at least three (3) business days or more before the payment is
      scheduled to be made. Fees may apply for a stop payment. Please see our List of All Fees
      above for more information. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in
      writing and get it to us within fourteen (14) days after you call. If you order us to stop
      one of these payments three (3) business days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and
      we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages.`,

      `<b>Refunds for Purchases Made with the Virtual Card.</b> Any refund for goods or services
      purchased with the Virtual Card Account will be made in the form of a credit to the Virtual
      Card. You are not entitled to receive a cash refund.`,

      `<b>Disputes with Merchants.</b> We are not responsible for the delivery, quality, safety,
      legality or any other aspect of goods and services that you purchase from others with a
      Virtual Card. All such disputes should be addressed to the merchants from whom the goods
      and services were purchased.`,

      `<b>Reversal</b> Point of sale transactions cannot be reversed. If you authorize a
      transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may
      result in a hold of funds equal to the estimated purchase amount, for up to seven (7)
      days.`,

      `<b>List of All Fees.</b> We will charge you, and you agree to pay, the fees and charges set
      forth (see List of All Fees above). You may also login at www.creditacademy.io to view a

      the List of All Fees, if there is a fee for such service it will be disclosed at that time,
      and you agree that any such fee may be deducted from your Virtual Card Account.`,

      '<b>Receipts and Transaction History.</b>',

      `<b>Receipts.</b>  You should get a receipt from the merchant at the time you make a

      about the amount of money you have remaining in your Virtual Card Account by calling

      (see List of All Fees above). You may also obtain your balance information, along with a
      12-month history of your Virtual Card Account transactions, at no charge by logging in to
      your Virtual Card Account at www.creditacademy.io. You also have the right to obtain at

      than once per month. See our List of All Fees for fee information.`,

      `<b>Foreign Transactions.</b> If you make a purchase in a currency
      other than U.S. dollars, the amount deducted from your funds will be converted by the
      Mastercard Card Association into U.S. dollars. The Mastercard Card Association will
      establish a currency conversion rate for this convenience using a rate selected by the
      Mastercard Card Association from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets
      for the applicable central processing date which may vary from the rate the Mastercard Card
      Association itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable
      central processing date, in each instance. Fees may apply for foreign transactions (see
      List of All Fees above).`,

      `<b>Change in Terms.</b> Subject to the requirements and limitations of applicable law, we
      may at any time add to, delete or change the terms of this Agreement without advance notice
      to you except as required by law. Advance notice may not be given if we need to make the
      change immediately in order to maintain or restore the security of your Virtual Card or
      Virtual Card Account or any related payment system.`,

      `<b>Cancellation and Suspension.</b> We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to limit
      your use of the Virtual Card. We may refuse to issue a Virtual Card Account or may revoke or
      suspend your Virtual Card Account privileges with or without cause or notice, other than as
      required by applicable law. If you would like to cancel the use of your Virtual Card,
      contact us at 1-855-449-2273 or login to

      the instructions provided. You agree not to use or allow others to use an expired, revoked,
      cancelled, suspended or otherwise invalid Virtual Card. Our cancellation of Virtual Card
      Account privileges will not otherwise affect your rights and obligations under this
      Agreement. Unless you have engaged in fraud or other illegal activities using your Virtual
      Card, if your Virtual Card Account privileges are cancelled or suspended, you may request
      the unused balance to be returned to you via a check to the mailing address we have in our
      records. There may be a fee for this service (see List of All Fees above).`,

      Virtual Card only through its expiration date, which is included when you receive your

      Card Account after the expiration date, the transactions may not be processed. If there is
      a balance remaining in your Virtual Card Account upon expiration, a new Virtual Card may be
      issued to you. You must activate any newly issued Virtual Card in order to access the funds

      Virtual Card or Access Information has been lost or stolen or if you believe that an
      electronic funds transfer has been made without your permission. Telephoning us at
      1-855-449-2273 is the best way to minimize your possible losses. You could lose all the
      money in your Virtual Card Account. You agree that any unauthorized use does not include
      use by a person to whom you have given authority to use or access your Virtual Card Account

      your Virtual Card Account, you may not get back any money you lost after this period if we
      can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in
      time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from learning of

      reasonable period in our sole discretion.`,

      `<ul style='list-style-type: lower-roman'>
      <li>if, through no fault of ours, your Virtual Card funds are insufficient for the

      <li>if a computer system was not working properly and you knew about the problem when you
      started the transaction;</li>
      <li>if a merchant refuses to honor your Virtual Card;</li>
      <li>if circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood, terrorist attack or national

      take up to forty-five (45) days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to
      do this, we will provisionally credit your Virtual Card Account within ten (10) business
      days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the money during the time
      it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question

      AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. UNLESS YOU EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF ARBITRATION IN THE MANNER
      DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION.
      ARBITRATION REPLACES THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, TO
      ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY (EXCEPT AS MAY BE PROVIDED FOR IN THE ARBITRATION RULES), AND TO
      PARTICIPATE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS OR IN ANY CONSOLIDATED
      ARBITRATION PROCEEDING OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE
      IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</b>`,

      `<b>Agreement to Arbitrate.</b> You and we (defined below) agree that any Dispute (defined
      below) will be resolved by Arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate is governed by the
      Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and the substantive law of the State of
      Minnesota (without applying its choice-of-law rules).`,

      `<b>What Arbitration Is.</b> "Arbitration" is a means of having an independent third party
      resolve a Dispute. A "Dispute" is any claim or controversy of any kind between you and us.
      The term Dispute is to be given its broadest possible meaning and includes, without
      limitation, all claims or demands (whether past, present, or future, including events that
      occurred prior to your application for a Sunrise Banks account or Virtual Card and
      whether or not a Sunrise Banks Prepaid Mastercard Virtual Card is provided to you, based
      on any legal or equitable theory (contract, tort, or otherwise) and regardless of the
      type of relief sought (i.e., money, injunctive relief, or declaratory relief). A Dispute
      includes, by way of example and without limitation, any claim based upon a federal or
      state constitution, statute, ordinance, regulation, or common law, and any issue
      concerning the validity, enforceability, or scope of this arbitration agreement.`,

      `For purposes of this arbitration agreement, the terms "you" and "your" include any
      Authorized User, co-signer, co-obligor, or guarantor and also your heirs, guardian,
      personal representative, or trustee in bankruptcy. The terms "we," "our," and "us" mean
      either the Bank and include employees, officers, directors, members, managers, attorneys,
      affiliated companies, predecessors, and assigns the Bank as well as the marketing,
      servicing, and collection representatives and agents of either or both.`,

      `<b>How Arbitration Works.</b> If a Dispute arises, the party asserting the claim or demand
      must initiate arbitration, provided you or we may first try to resolve the matter
      informally or through customary business methods, including collection activity. The party
      filing an arbitration complaint must choose either of the following arbitration firms for
      initiating and pursuing arbitration: The American Arbitration Association ("AAA") or JAMS,
      The Resolution Experts. If the parties mutually agree, a private party, such as a retired
      judge, may serve as the arbitrator. If you claim you have a Dispute with us, but do not
      initiate arbitration or select an arbitrator, we may do so. You may obtain copies of the
      current rules of each of the arbitration firms and forms and instructions for initiating
      arbitration by contacting them as follows:`,

      `American Arbitration Association<br />
      1633 Broadway, 10th Floor<br />
      New York, NY 10019<br />
      Web site: <a href="https://www.adr.org" target=”_blank”>www.adr.org</a><br />
      Telephone (800) 778-7879`,

      `JAMS, The Resolution Experts<br />
      1920 Main Street, Suite 300<br />
      Irvine, CA 92614<br />
      Web site: <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com" target=”_blank”>www.jamsadr.com</a><br />
      Telephone (949) 224-1810 or (800) 352-5267`,

      `In the event both AAA and JAMS are unavailable to decide a Dispute, the parties agree to
      select another neutral party experienced in financial matters to decide the Dispute. If
      such an independent arbitrator cannot be found, the parties agree to submit any Dispute to
      a state or federal judge, sitting without a jury, for resolution on an individual and not
      a class-wide basis.`,

      `The policies and procedures of the selected arbitration firm will apply provided such
      policies and procedures are consistent with this arbitration agreement. To the extent the
      arbitration firm's rules or procedures are different than the terms of this arbitration
      agreement, the terms of this arbitration agreement will apply.`,

      `<b>What Arbitration Costs.</b> No matter which party initiates the arbitration, we will
      advance or reimburse filing fees and other costs or fees of arbitration, provided each
      party will be initially responsible for its own attorneys' fees and related costs. Unless
      prohibited by law, the arbitrator may award fees, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees to
      the party who substantially prevails in the arbitration.`,

      `<b>Location of Arbitration.</b> Unless you and we agree to a different location, the
      arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.`,

      `<b>Waiver of Rights.</b> You are waiving your right to a jury trial, to have a court decide
      your Dispute, to participate in a class action lawsuit, and to certain discovery and other
      procedures that are available in a lawsuit. You and we agree that the arbitrator has no
      authority to conduct class-wide arbitration proceedings and is only authorized to resolve
      the individual Disputes between you and us. The validity, effect, and enforceability of this
      waiver of class action lawsuit and class-wide arbitration, if challenged, are to be
      determined solely by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by the AAA, JAMS, or an
      arbitrator. If such court refuses to enforce the waiver of class-wide arbitration, the
      Dispute will proceed in court and be decided by a judge, sitting without a jury, according
      to applicable court rules and procedures, and not as a class action lawsuit. The arbitrator
      has the ability to award all remedies available by statute, at law, or in equity to the
      prevailing party.`,

      `<b>Applicable Law and Review of Arbitrator's Award.</b> The arbitrator shall apply
      applicable federal and Minnesota substantive law and the terms of this Agreement. The
      arbitrator must apply the terms of this arbitration agreement, including without limitation
      the waiver of class-wide arbitration. The arbitrator shall make written findings and the
      arbitrator's award may be filed with any court having jurisdiction. The arbitration award
      shall be supported by substantial evidence and must be consistent with this Agreement and
      with applicable law, and if it is not, it may be set aside by a court. The parties shall
      have, in addition to the grounds referred to in the Federal Arbitration Act for vacating,
      modifying, or correcting an award, the right to judicial review of (a) whether the findings
      of fact rendered by the arbitrator are supported by substantial evidence and (b) whether
      the conclusions of law are erroneous under the substantive law of Minnesota and applicable
      federal law. Judgment confirming an award in such a proceeding may be entered only if a
      court determines that the award is supported by substantial evidence and is not based on
      legal error under the substantive law of Minnesota and applicable federal law.`,

      `<b>Surviva.</b> This arbitration provision shall survive: (1) cancellation, payment,
      charge-off, or assignment of this Agreement; (2) the bankruptcy of any party; and (3) any
      transfer, sale, or assignment of this Agreement, or any amounts owed under this Agreement,
      to any other person or entity.`,

      `<i><b>Right to Opt-Out.</b> If you do not wish to agree to arbitrate all Disputes in
      accordance with the terms and conditions of this section, you must advise us in writing at
      the following address by either hand delivery or a letter postmarked within thirty (30)
      days following the date you enter into this Agreement. You may opt-out without affecting
      your application or cardholder status.</i><br />

      `<b>Assignability.</b> We may assign or transfer our rights and obligations under this
      Agreement at any time without prior notice to you. The Virtual Card Account established
      under this Agreement is not assignable or transferable by you. Notwithstanding the
      foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding on you, your Authorized Users, your heirs,
      your executors, administrators, guardians, personal representatives, or trustee in
      bankruptcy.`,

      `<b>Miscellaneous Provisions:</b> We do not waive our rights by delaying or failing to
      execute them at any time. To the extent permitted by law and as permitted by the Waiver
      of Jury Trial and Arbitration above, you agree to be liable to us for any loss, costs, or
      expenses that we may incur as a result of any dispute or legal proceeding involving your
      Account.  If a court finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, such
      finding shall not make the rest of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable. To the fullest
      extent possible, any such provision shall be deemed to be modified so as to be rendered
      enforceable or valid; however, if such provision cannot be so modified, it shall be
      stricken and all other provisions of this Agreement in all other respects shall remain
      valid and enforceable.`,
